sdl2-ttf
========

Haskell bindings for the True Type Font library for SDL.

- libsdl (https://www.libsdl.org)
- sdl2-ttf (https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)

I am not the original author of this library, credit for that goes
to @osa1 and friends. Their version was dependent on a different implementation
of Haskell SDL2 bindings. My needs were different as I am using the `sdl2`
package from Hackage.

I could not find a suitable sdl2-ttf library so I forked the `hsSDL2-ttf`
implementation and here we are.

Tests and further functionality will be added over time. 

This is pretty much an alpha release. :<

Hopefully it will be considered good enough to go up on hackage!

Pull requests, suggestions, advice, feature requests are all invited!
